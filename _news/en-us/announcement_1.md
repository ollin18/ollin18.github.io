I'm starting my road trip from Vermont to California today! :car: :desert_island: :cactus: :sunny: :ocean:

This will be a 4,000 mile journey that will take me through some of the most beautiful and diverse landscapes in the United States. I'll be driving through the Appalachian Mountains, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada before finally reaching the Pacific Ocean in California.
