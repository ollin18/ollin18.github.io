After 2 incredible years working as a Data Scientist at THINKMD in my beloved Burlington, Vermont, I'm thrilled to announce that I've embarked on a new journey as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California, Berkeley! :tada: :tada: :tada:

This is an incredible opportunity that I've been chasing back from 2016 when I first met my P.I. Dr. Marta C. Gonz√°lez at the SoFiA conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina and later at the LaNet conference in Cartagena, Colombia in 2019. I've been following her work and replicating her results ever since then. I can't wait to contribute to her research group and learn from the best in the field!
