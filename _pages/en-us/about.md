Hi, I’m Ollin. Welcome to my personal website! I’m a researcher and data scientist working at the intersection of urban systems, economic complexity, and environmental resilience. My work explores how people move, live, and work in cities from a complex systems perspective. I’m super interested in geospatial analysis, and computational social science in general. I build models, visualizations, and open data tools to better understand inequality and to support inclusive, evidence-based policy. I’m also passionate about linking science and action through storytelling and science communication. I believe in making research accessible and useful to decision-makers, communities, and the broader audience.
