**Emil**. Son of McFly and Layla, he was born right where he lives... and he knows. He thinks he's the boss of the house, but we all know who really is. The most adorable piece of fluff that will follow you to the end of the World. He needs to know everything like a small Paty Chapoy. If you have something in your hands, he wants to know what it is. Did you open a bag? time for him to check what's inside. He never learned how to kiss, but he tries.
