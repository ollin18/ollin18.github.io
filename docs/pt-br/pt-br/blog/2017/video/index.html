<p>This is a network representation of the voting patterns of the mexican senate in the LXII and LXIII legislatures between 2012 and 2017. Only non-unanimous bills are used and each billâ€™s weight is multiplyied by the minimum between the count of PRO and CON in order to give larger weights to the more controversial topics.</p>

<p>Every static representation means a certain trimester that takes into account all the votes and absences from all the senators in that period. The links are obtained by adding every time a pair of senators voted the same way or were absent together at a certain bill from that specific trimester, then normalized by the maximum and only kept the links greater than a 0.5 threshold.</p>

<p>You might realize that there are not 2nd and 3rd trimesters in 2017 and the reason is that no CON vote was casted that semester. Each color represents a party.</p>
