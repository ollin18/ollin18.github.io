      I studied physics at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)
      where I had my first approach to computers and programming. I always had
      a great interest in astrophysics which led me to do my social service
      at the Nuclear Science Institute (ICN) in astroparticles topics.
      Even though I really love the outter space I've always felt an intense atraction to
      the social sciences so must of my non-compulsory subjects were in economics
      and sociophysics.

      After taking account of how data science can help improve the life of
      the common people I decided to drive my career in that direction. For that
      reason I studied a data science masters at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo
      de México (ITAM) where I've improved my way in the computer and statistical
      techniques.
      My research interest are computational social sciences, machine learning,
      network theory and bayesian statistics.
      I absolutetly love JuliaLang, NeoVim and the open source community. I'm
      alway willing to share, teach and help.

      My alterego is an artistic fellow who has studied latin and classical percussions,
      classical guitar, worked as a photographer, can spend whole days at the museum,
      loves to play and listens to jazz and enjoys all kinds of movies.

      Both of us love to play soccer, have run a marathon, enjoys rock climbing and
      commutes in bicycle.
