Amazing book, very easy to follow and entertaining to read. Carla Escoffié does a great job explaining the complex issue of housing in Mexico City, and how it affects the lives of its inhabitants. The book now only talks about the gentrification process happening in Mexico City but also guides you through the idea of housing especulation, the right to the city, and how housing is a human right. How mega-projects and real estate developments are displacing low-income communities and how this process is affecting the social fabric of cities in Mexico.
