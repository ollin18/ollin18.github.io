Great book to understand the dynamics of gentrification and displacement in urban areas. The author, Andrew Lee, provides a comprehensive analysis of how communities resist displacement through various strategies and interventions.
It also provides a deep understanding of the socio-economic and political factors that contribute to gentrification, making it a must-read for urban planners, sociologists, and anyone interested in social justice.
