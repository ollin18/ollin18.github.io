This is a network representation of the voting patterns of the mexican senate in the LXII and LXIII legislatures between 2012 and 2017. Only non-unanimous bills are used and each bill's weight is multiplyied by the minimum between the count of PRO and CON in order to give larger weights to the more controversial topics.

Every static representation means a certain trimester that takes into account all the votes and absences from all the senators in that period. The links are obtained by adding every time a pair of senators voted the same way or were absent together at a certain bill from that specific trimester, then normalized by the maximum and only kept the links greater than a 0.5 threshold.

You might realize that there are not 2nd and 3rd trimesters in 2017 and the reason is that no CON vote was casted that semester. Each color represents a party.
